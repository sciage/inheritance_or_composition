Inheritance Or Composition
==========================

![](assets/app_icon.png)

An conceptual sample of how you can build Android Applications using Inheritance and Composition techniques. This repository is the complement of my talk named "Inheritance or Composition, that is the Question" also you can find the slides of that talk, [here](https://speakerdeck.com/txusballesteros/inheritance-or-composition).

## Goal of the Repository

I have created this repository only with learning purposes and I hope that this source-code can helps to another developers to see an alternative way to build their Android applications.

I'm sure that if you're taking a look to this repository, probably you have your self opinion or approach about these concept. Please feel-free to share your opinion or comments in the repository or send your pull request. Will be a pleasure for me, see other opinions or approachs.

## Branches

The repository has two different branches both with the same functionality of the app.

* The first one is the branch named [Inheritance & Legacy](https://github.com/txusballesteros/inheritance_or_composition/tree/inheritance_and_legacy), this branch contains the sourcecode with an approach based on inheritance.

* The second branch named as [Composition](https://github.com/txusballesteros/inheritance_or_composition/tree/composition), contains the sourcecode with an approach based on composition.
