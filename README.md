## Goal

I have created this repository only with learning purposes and I hope that this source code can helps to the developers to see a different way of think when they will build software.

I'm sure that if you're taking a look to this repository, probably you have got your self opinion or approach about this concept. Please feel-free to share your opinion with the community.

## Branches

The repository has two different branches both with the same functionality of the app.

* The first one is the branch named [Inheritance & Legacy](https://github.com/txusballesteros/inheritance_or_composition/tree/inheritance_and_legacy), this branch contains the sourcecode with an approach based on inheritance.

* The first second is the branch named [Composition](https://github.com/txusballesteros/inheritance_or_composition/tree/composition), this branch contains the sourcecode with an approach based on composition.
